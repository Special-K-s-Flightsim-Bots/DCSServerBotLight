# Plugin "Cloud"
If you opt in to the cloud plugin, you participate in the global ban system. We've put together a group consisting of 
the admins of the most popular DCS-servers, and we monitor what's going on in the community. When we see someone that is 
crashing servers by hacking or any other **really** (really) bad stuff, we put them in the global ban list. 
Nobody that gets usually banned on a server for misbehaviour will get onto that list. There are only the real bad guys 
on it.</br>
If you opt in to that plugin, you participate from that ban list already.</br>
If you are a server admin of a large server and not part of DGSA yet, send me a DM.
