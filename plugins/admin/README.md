# Plugin "Admin"
This plugin supports administrative commands that are needed to operate a DCS server remotely.

## Configuration
Currently, most of the configuration affecting the admin plugin. is still being done in the dcsserverbot.ini.<br>
An exception is the .download command. You can specify, which folders / patterns you want to offer your admins to
download from your server. There is a default list being loaded, if no list is provided. The format is self-explanatory.

```json
{
  "configs": [
    {
      "downloads": [
        { "label": "DCS Logs", "directory": "%USERPROFILE%\\Saved Games\\{server.installation}\\logs", "pattern": "dcs.log*", "target": "<id:{config[ADMIN_CHANNEL]}>" },
        { "label": "DCSServerBot Logs", "directory": ".", "pattern": "dcsserverbot.log*", "target": "%USERPROFILE%\\Downloads" },
        { "label": "Missions", "directory": "%USERPROFILE%\\Saved Games\\{server.installation}\\Missions", "pattern": "*.miz" },
        { "label": "Tacview", "directory": "%USERPROFILE%\\Documents\\Tacview", "pattern": "Tacview-*.acmi", "target": "<id:12345678901234567>" },
        { "label": "Config Files", "directory": ".\\config", "pattern": "*.json" },
        { "label": "dcsserverbot.ini", "directory": ".\\config", "pattern": "dcsserverbot.ini" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
When using the .download command, you can select which "label" you want to download.<br/>
If "target" is not provided, the file will be sent as a DM. If sending as a DM exceeds the limits of 8 MB, it tries to 
download to the current channel.</br>
"target" can be anything from a file path to a channel (see example above).

In addition, you can upload embeds to discord channels, just by using json files like this:

```json
{
  "message_id": 967120121632006228,
  "title": "Special K successfully landed at Senaki!",
  "description": "Special K did it again and succeeded at his try to land at Senaki.",
  "img": "https://i.chzbgr.com/full/8459987200/hB315ED4E/damn-instruction-manual",
  "fields": [
    {
      "name": "Pilot",
      "value": "sexy as hell",
      "inline": true
    },
    {
      "name": "Speed",
      "value": "130 kn",
      "inline": true
    },
    {
      "name": "Wind",
      "value": "calm",
      "inline": true
    }
  ],
  "footer": "Just kidding, they forgot to put their gear down!"
}
```

Just upload a file with such a content and a .json extension to the channel where you want the information to be 
displayed (can be done by the Admin-Role only!). If you provide a valid message_id, the message will be updated.

## Config File Uploads
Every config file that either the bot uses for itself (dcsserverbot.ini) or the different plugins use (_<plugin>_.json)
can be uploaded in the admin channels by a user belonging to the Admin group. The files will be replaced, 
the dedicated plugin will be reloaded or the bot will be restarted (security question applies), if you update the 
dcsserverbot.ini. **All changes will happen on the bot that is controlling the server of that admin channel!**
